# HTW Master's Thesis Template

by yours truly Felix Riedel

## Usage

I prefer using IntelliJ in combination with GitHub as a free alternative to Overleaf.
A `.idea` folder already exists that holds the run configs for running latex locally.
Make sure that you have installed BibTex, LaTeX, Texify. 

Alternatively just copy everything into overleaf and it should work like a charm too.
