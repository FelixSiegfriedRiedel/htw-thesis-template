Such interfaces are powered by a mix of query modalities and machine learning methods for analytics, and are relying on Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language generation. However, critical challenges hinder their adoption. The question we discuss is how to devise reliable Conversational Data Analytics (CDA) systems producing timely, consistent, and verifiable answers. To reach this goal, we identify five properties that impose a paradigm shift in the way systems are built and in the way they interact with users. To illustrate that shift, we describe a prototypical CDA system. Realizing these properties involves either extending existing components, or redesigning components from scratch; both solutions require overcoming data management challenges and conducting a tight integration with advanced data management and machine learning techniques.},

However, business departments often distrust LLM-based text-to-SQL systems due to the probabilistic nature of SQL generation, which can result in incorrect but executable SQL queries caused by model hallucinations. This leads to significant concerns regarding the accuracy and reliability of the queried data. In this paper, we present RBDQ, a novel LLM-based text-to-SQL system designed to address the unique challenges of business data queries. RBDQ innovatively introduces the Hierarchical Metrics Query Method and integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods along with a self-reflection mechanism to tackle these challenges. RBDQ effectively meets the requirements of business metric queries in real-world scenarios. Currently implemented in the Quality Assurance department at ByteDance, RBDQ has significantly improved operational efficiency and query flexibility. Our experiments demonstrate the system's effectiveness, achieving an Execution Accuracy of 96.20\%.},

We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric architecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting, consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations. Building on this foundation, we further propose an enhanced variant that leverages graph-based memory representations to capture complex relational structures among conversational elements. Through comprehensive evaluations on LOCOMO benchmark, we systematically compare our approaches against six baseline categories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context approach that processes the entire conversation history, (iv) an open-source memory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a dedicated memory management platform. Empirical results show that our methods consistently outperform all existing memory systems across four question categories: single-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. Notably, Mem0 achieves 26\% relative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with graph memory achieves around 2\% higher overall score than the base configuration. Beyond accuracy gains, we also markedly reduce computational overhead compared to full-context method. In particular, Mem0 attains a 91\% lower p95 latency and saves more than 90\% token cost, offering a compelling balance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment constraints. Our findings highlight critical role of structured, persistent memory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving the way for more reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents.},

However, their deployment in sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, and legal services raises critical concerns about privacy and data security. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for embedding trust mechanisms into LLMs to dynamically control the disclosure of sensitive information. The framework integrates three core components: User Trust Profiling, Information Sensitivity Detection, and Adaptive Output Control. By leveraging techniques such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), Named Entity Recognition (NER), contextual analysis, and privacy-preserving methods like differential privacy, the system ensures that sensitive information is disclosed appropriately based on the user's trust level. By focusing on balancing data utility and privacy, the proposed solution offers a novel approach to securely deploying LLMs in high-risk environments. Future work will focus on testing this framework across various domains to evaluate its effectiveness in managing sensitive data while maintaining system efficiency.}

Moreover, we offer a rule of thumb for developing Text-to-SQL solutions. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and open problems of Text-to-SQL in the LLMs era.},

However, despite their zero-shot capabilities, these agents to date do not continually improve over time, beyond performance refinement on a specific task. Here we present CLIN, the first language-based agent to achieve this, so that it continually improves over multiple trials, including when both the environment and task are varied, and without requiring parameter updates. Our approach is to use a persistent, dynamic, textual memory, centered on causal abstractions (rather than general ``helpful hints''), that is regularly updated after each trial so that the agent gradually learns useful knowledge for new trials. In the ScienceWorld benchmark, CLIN is able to continually improve on repeated trials on the same task and environment, outperforming state-of-the-art reflective language agents like Reflexion by 23 absolute points. CLIN can also transfer its learning to new environments (or new tasks), improving its zero-shot performance by 4 points (13 for new tasks) and can further improve performance there through continual memory updates, enhancing performance by an additional 17 points (7 for new tasks). This suggests a new architecture for agents built on frozen models that can still continually and rapidly improve over time.},

Using this technique, we introduce MemGPT (MemoryGPT), a system that intelligently manages different storage tiers in order to effectively provide extended context within the LLM's limited context window. We evaluate our OS-inspired design in two domains where the limited context windows of modern LLMs severely handicaps their performance: document analysis, where MemGPT is able to analyze large documents that far exceed the underlying LLM's context window, and multi-session chat, where MemGPT can create conversational agents that remember, reflect, and evolve dynamically through long-term interactions with their users.
